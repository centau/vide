# Element Creation API

<br/>

## create()

Creates a new UI element, applying any given properties.

- ### Type

    ```lua
    type Properties = Map<string | number, any>

    function create(class: string): (Properties) -> Instance
    function create(instance: Instance): (Properties) -> Instance

    ```

- ### Details

    The function can take either a `string` or an `Instance` as its first argument.

    - If given a `string`, a new instance with the same class name will be created.
    - If given an `Instance`, a new instance that is a clone of the given instance
    will be created.

    This returns another function that is used to apply any properties to the new
    instance.

- ### Property setting rules

    - If a table value is another table, that nested table is processed so that
      any properties inside that table are also applied to the instance just
      like the outer table.
    - If a table index is a string:
      - If its value is a function then it will either bind that property to
        a state or connect it if the property type is a `RBXScriptSignal`.
      - If the value is not a function then the property will be set to that
        value.
    - If a table index is a number:
      - If its value is a function then it will parent any instances returned by
        that function as children.
      - If its value is an instance then it will be parented to the instance.

- ### Example

    Basic element creation.

    ```lua
    local frame = create "Frame" {
        Name = "NewFrame",
        Position = UDim2.fromScale(1, 0)
    }
    ```

    A component using property nesting/grouping.

    ```lua
    type Layout = {
        Layout = {
            Position: UDim2?,
            Size: UDim2?,
            AnchorPoint: Vector2?
        }
    }

    type Children = {
        Children = Array<Instance>
    }

    function Background(props: Layout & Children & {
        Color: Color3
    })
        return create "Frame" {
            BackgroundColor3 = Color,
            props.Layout,
            props.Children
        }
    end
    ```
