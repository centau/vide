# Introduction

This is a brief tutorial designed to give you a quick run through the usage of
Vide.

Vide is largely inspired by other UI libraries such as Solid and Fusion.

## Why Vide?

Creating UI is a slow and tedious process. The purpose of Vide is to make UI
declarative and concise, making it faster to create and more importantly easier
to maintain. Vide achieves this using a reactive style of programming which
allows you to focus on the flow of data through your application without
worrying about manually updating UI instances.

Some of the main focuses behind Vide's design choices:

- Concise syntax to reduce verbosity as much as possible.
- Reducing the amount of imports needed for usage by using Luau's syntax and
  semantics.
- Being completely typecheckable.
- Flexibility, particularly with integrating other libraries and allowing users
  to use their own patterns.
