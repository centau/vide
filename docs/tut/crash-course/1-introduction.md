# Introduction

This is a tutorial that introduces the concepts and usage of Vide.

Vide is heavily inspired by [Solid](https://www.solidjs.com/).

## Why Vide?

Vide provides a reactive and declarative API to simplify managing UI.

Some of the main focuses behind Vide's design choices:

- Minimal syntax
- Complete typechecking
- Independence from instances
