# Introduction

This is a tutorial that introduces the concepts and usage of Vide.

Vide is heavily inspired by [Solid](https://www.solidjs.com/).

This tutorial assumes familiarity with Luau and Roblox UI.

## Why Vide?

Creating UI is complicated, slow, and tedious.

Vide tries to simplify and speed up this process by providing a declarative and
reactive of style programming, which lets you focus more on designing the UI
itself and not having to manually update or reparent UI instances.

Some of the main focuses behind Vide's design choices:

- Minimal syntax.
- Complete typechecking
- Independence from instances.

As with most declarative libraries, there is an initial learning curve to
understand the concepts and usage. This tutorial tries to comprehensively
cover these concepts and usage, more so than you need just to use it.
