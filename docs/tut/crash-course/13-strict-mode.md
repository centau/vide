# Strict Mode

While developing UI with Vide, you should use Vide's strict mode, which can
be set with `vide.strict = true` once when you first require Vide. Strict mode
will add extra safety checks and emit better error traces, particularly when
errors occur in property bindings.

Strict mode is automatically enabled when Vide is required in O0 or O1
optimization (default studio level). You can `vide.strict = false` if you do not
want this.

Strict mode will run derived sources and effects twice each time they update.
This is to help ensure that derived source computations are pure, and that any
cleanups made in derived sources or effects are done properly.

```lua
local source = vide.source
local effect = vide.effect

vide.strict = true

local count = source(0)

local ran = 0
effect(function()
    ran += 1
end)

print(ran) -- 2
count(1)
print(ran) -- 4
```

A full list of what strict mode will do can be found
[here](../../api/strict-mode).
