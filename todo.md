# todo

- auto-enable of strict mode depending on compiler optimizaton level
- property binding optimization
  - would no longer allow `cleanup()` usage in binding scopes
- solution to nested reactivity, see: SolidJS stores
- investigate performance of wide graphs
- optimize child removal
- implement from solid:
  - Portal
  - batch
- optimize `indexes()` double-diffing
- define behavior of deriving a source within a derived source
- review destruction of node under a root that has a child in another root
- check in strict mode for forgetting to call constructor `create(class)`
- improve crash course, some sections feel like information dumps
